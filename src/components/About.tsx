          Welcome! I‚Äôm Kshitij, a scholar-practitioner committed to social justice in sport and recreation. My work centers on critical pedagogy, inclusive design, and community-based research. Through both scholarship and teaching, I aim to challenge norms, uplift marginalized voices, and reimagine what equitable access and leadership look like in leisure spaces.
          
          </p>
          <p>
My teaching philosophy centers on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and queer pedagogical strategies, prioritizing psychological safety and intersectional inclusivity. Drawing from my experience as a Teaching Assistant  at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I empower students to navigate real-world challenges through active learning, such as role-playing conflict scenarios involving marginalized identities or designing LGBTQ+-inclusive marketing campaigns.

          </p>
          <p>
           
         My research examines leisure experiences of marginalized communities including LGBTQ+, Latino and Latinx populations, and international graduate students. Key projects include Natural Spaces and the Queer Identity, which explores LGBTQ+ experiences in outdoor recreation, and studies around the impact of gentrification on Hispanic community well-being. I draw on spatial design knowledge from my background in architecture and environmental planning to advocate for inclusive facilities and adaptive sports programs. I have authored three peer-reviewed publications that examine diversity, equity, and inclusion in leisure contexts. My upcoming manuscript, Beyond Binaries: Reimagining Leisure Education Through Queer Pedagogy, accepted in SCHOLE, contributes to critical conversations on rethinking binary norms in education.
          </p>
          <p>
Thanks for stopping by! I hope this space offers a window into the work I do and the values I carry with me.
